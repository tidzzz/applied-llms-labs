##  The Manager with Specialists Analogy

**Imagine you're a project manager with a team of specialists:**

-  Data Analyst - can query databases
-  Researcher - can search the web
-  Accountant - can do calculations
- ️ Assistant - can send emails

When someone asks: *"What's our revenue growth this quarter compared to last year?"*

You (the manager) don't do everything yourself. You:
1. **Reason**: "I need data from the database and calculations"
2. **Act**: Ask the Data Analyst for revenue data
3. **Observe**: Review the data received
4. **Reason**: "Now I need to calculate the percentage change"
5. **Act**: Ask the Accountant to do the math
6. **Observe**: Get the calculated result
7. **Reason**: "Now I have the answer"
8. **Respond**: Give the final answer

**AI Agents work the same way!**

They:
- **Think** about what needs to be done (Reasoning)
- **Choose** the right tool (Decision Making)
- **Use** the tool (Acting)
- **Evaluate** the result (Observation)
- **Repeat** until they have the answer
- **Respond** to the user

*Both project managers and AI agents delegate tasks to specialists/tools, following the same iterative pattern.*

##  What Are Agents?

### Standard LLM (No Agency or Tools)

```
User: "What's the current weather in Paris?"
LLM: "I cannot access real-time weather data. I can only provide general information..."
```

### Agent with Tools

```
User: "What's the current weather in Paris?"
Agent: [Thinks] "I need to use the weather tool"
Agent: [Uses] get_weather(city="Paris")
Agent: [Observes] "18°C, partly cloudy"
Agent: [Responds] "It's currently 18°C and partly cloudy in Paris"
```

<img src="images/llm-vs-agent.png" alt="Standard LLM vs Agent with Tools" width="800"/>

*Agents with tools can access real-time data and take actions, while standard LLMs are limited to their training data.*

---

##  The ReAct Pattern

ReAct = **Rea**soning + **Act**ing

Agents follow this iterative loop:

```
1. Thought: What should I do next?
2. Action: Use a specific tool
3. Observation: What did the tool return?
4. (Repeat 1-3 as needed)
5. Final Answer: Respond to the user
```

**Example**:
```
User: "Calculate 25 * 17, then tell me if it's a prime number"

Thought 1: I need to calculate 25 * 17
Action 1: calculator(expression="25 * 17")
Observation 1: 425

Thought 2: I need to check if 425 is prime
Action 2: is_prime(number=425)
Observation 2: False (divisible by 5)

Final Answer: "25 * 17 equals 425, which is not a prime number
because it's divisible by 5."
```

<img src="images/react-pattern-flow.png" alt="ReAct Pattern Flow Diagram" width="800"/>

*The ReAct pattern: Agents iteratively reason about what to do, act by using tools, observe results, and repeat until they have the answer.*

##  Building Agents with create_agent()

LangChain Python provides `create_agent()` from `langchain.agents` - a high-level API that handles the ReAct loop automatically. This is the **recommended approach** for building production agents.

**What create_agent() does for you**:
-  Manages the ReAct loop (Thought → Action → Observation → Repeat)
-  Handles message history automatically
-  Implements iteration limits to prevent infinite loops
-  Provides production-ready error handling
-  Returns clean, structured responses

---

### Example 1: Basic Agent with create_agent()

Let's see how to use `create_agent()` to create an autonomous agent that handles the ReAct loop (Thought → Action → Observation) automatically.

**Key code you'll work with:**
```python
# Create agent using create_agent() - that's it!
agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[calculator],  # Pass tools to the agent
)

# Use the agent with messages array
response = agent.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]})

# Get the final answer from the last message
last_message = response["messages"][-1]
```

**Code**: [`code/01_create_agent_basic.py`](./code/01_create_agent_basic.py)  
**Run**: `python 05-agents/code/01_create_agent_basic.py`

**Example code:**

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

# Define a calculator tool for the agent
@tool
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    """A calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations.
    
    Args:
        expression: The mathematical expression to evaluate
    """
    result = eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, {})
    return str(result)

def main():
    # Create agent using create_agent() - that's it!
    agent = create_agent(
        model=os.getenv("AI_MODEL"),
        tools=[calculator],
        system_prompt="You are a helpful math assistant.",
    )

    # Use the agent with messages array
    query = "What is 125 * 8?"
    response = agent.invoke({
        "messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]
    })

    # Get the final answer from the last message
    last_message = response["messages"][-1]
    print(f"Agent: {last_message.content}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Expected Output

```
 Agent with create_agent() Example

 User: What is 125 * 8?

 Agent: 125 × 8 = 1000

 Under the hood:
   create_agent() implements the ReAct pattern (Thought → Action → Observation)
   and handles all the boilerplate for you.
```

### How It Works

**What's happening behind the scenes**:
1. **Agent receives query**: "What is 125 * 8?"
2. **Reasons**: Determines it needs the calculator tool
3. **Acts**: Executes `calculator(expression="125 * 8")`
4. **Observes**: Gets result "1000"
5. **Responds**: Formats natural language response

---

### Example 2: create_agent() with Multiple Tools

Let's see how to give an agent multiple tools using `tools=[tool1, tool2, tool3]` and observe how it autonomously selects the right one.

**Key code you'll work with:**
```python
# Create agent with all three tools - agent auto-selects the right one
agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[calculator, get_weather, search],  # Multiple tools!
)

# Agent automatically picks the correct tool for each query
queries = [
    "What is 50 * 25?",              # → Uses calculator
    "What's the weather in Tokyo?",  # → Uses get_weather
    "Tell me about LangChain",       # → Uses search
]
```

**Code**: [`code/02_create_agent_multi_tool.py`](./code/02_create_agent_multi_tool.py)  
**Run**: `python 05-agents/code/02_create_agent_multi_tool.py`

**Example code:**

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

@tool
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    """Perform mathematical calculations."""
    result = eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, {})
    return str(result)

@tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a city."""
    temps = {"Seattle": 62, "Paris": 18, "Tokyo": 24}
    temp = temps.get(city, 72)
    return f"Current weather in {city}: {temp}°F"

@tool
def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search for information about a topic."""
    return f"LangChain is a Python framework for building AI applications with LLMs."

def main():
    # Create agent with all three tools
    agent = create_agent(
        model=os.getenv("AI_MODEL"),
        tools=[calculator, get_weather, search],
        system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant with access to multiple tools.",
    )

    # Agent automatically picks the correct tool for each query
    queries = [
        "What is 50 * 25?",              # → Uses calculator
        "What's the weather in Tokyo?",  # → Uses get_weather
        "Tell me about LangChain",       # → Uses search
    ]

    for query in queries:
        response = agent.invoke({
            "messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]
        })
        last_message = response["messages"][-1]
        print(f"User: {query}")
        print(f"Agent: {last_message.content}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Expected Output

```
️  Multi-Tool Agent with create_agent()

 User: What is 50 * 25?
 Agent: 50 multiplied by 25 equals 1250.

 User: What's the weather in Tokyo?
 Agent: Current weather in Tokyo: 24°F

 User: Tell me about LangChain
 Agent: LangChain is a Python framework for building applications with large
language models (LLMs).

 What just happened:
   • The agent automatically selected the right tool for each query
   • Calculator for math (50 * 25)
   • Weather tool for Tokyo weather
   • Search tool for LangChain information
   • All with the same agent instance!
```

### How It Works

**What's happening**:
1. **Agent receives query**: "What is 50 * 25?"
2. **Reads tool descriptions**: Reviews all available tools
3. **Selects best match**: Calculator tool (description mentions "mathematical calculations")
4. **Executes tool**: Runs calculator with the expression
5. **Returns natural response**: Formats the result in natural language

**Tool Selection Logic**:
- The agent uses tool **names** and **descriptions** to match queries to tools
- More specific descriptions → Better tool selection
- The LLM decides which tool fits best based on semantic meaning
- You can give your agent multiple tools, and it will intelligently pick the right one for each task

---

### Example 3: Manual ReAct Loop (Understanding the Pattern)

To understand what `create_agent()` does under the hood, let's implement the ReAct loop manually.

**Code**: [`code/03_manual_react.py`](./code/03_manual_react.py)  
**Run**: `python 05-agents/code/03_manual_react.py`

**Example code:**

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, ToolMessage
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

@tool
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    """Perform mathematical calculations."""
    result = eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, {})
    return str(result)

@tool
def is_prime(number: int) -> str:
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if number < 2:
        return "False"
    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return f"False (divisible by {i})"
    return "True"

def run_react_loop(query: str, tools: list, max_iterations: int = 5):
    """Manually implement the ReAct loop."""
    
    model = ChatOpenAI(
        model=os.getenv("AI_MODEL"),
        base_url=os.getenv("AI_ENDPOINT"),
        api_key=os.getenv("AI_API_KEY")
    )
    
    # Create tool lookup
    tools_by_name = {t.name: t for t in tools}
    
    # Bind tools to model
    model_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools)
    
    # Initialize messages
    messages = [HumanMessage(content=query)]
    
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        print(f"\n--- Iteration {iteration + 1} ---")
        
        # Step 1: Call the model
        response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
        messages.append(response)
        
        # Step 2: Check if there are tool calls
        if not response.tool_calls:
            print("No more tool calls - Final answer ready")
            return response.content
        
        # Step 3: Execute each tool call
        for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
            tool_name = tool_call["name"]
            tool_args = tool_call["args"]
            
            print(f"Action: {tool_name}({tool_args})")
            
            # Execute the tool
            tool_result = tools_by_name[tool_name].invoke(tool_args)
            print(f"Observation: {tool_result}")
            
            # Add tool result to messages
            messages.append(
                ToolMessage(content=str(tool_result), tool_call_id=tool_call["id"])
            )
    
    return "Max iterations reached"

def main():
    tools = [calculator, is_prime]
    
    query = "Calculate 25 * 17, then tell me if the result is a prime number"
    print(f"Query: {query}")
    
    result = run_react_loop(query, tools)
    print(f"\n Final Answer: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Expected Output

```
Query: Calculate 25 * 17, then tell me if the result is a prime number

--- Iteration 1 ---
Action: calculator({'expression': '25 * 17'})
Observation: 425

--- Iteration 2 ---
Action: is_prime({'number': 425})
Observation: False (divisible by 5)

--- Iteration 3 ---
No more tool calls - Final answer ready

 Final Answer: 25 * 17 equals 425, which is not a prime number 
because it is divisible by 5.
```

##  Additional Agent Patterns

Now that you understand how to build basic agents with single and multiple tools, let's explore an additional pattern for production applications: **middleware**. Middleware lets you add behavior like logging, error handling, and dynamic model selection without modifying your tools or agent core logic.

### Example 4: create_agent() with Middleware

This example shows how to use **middleware** with `create_agent()` for production scenarios like dynamic model selection based on conversation complexity and graceful error handling.

**Key code you'll work with:**
```python
# Middleware intercepts agent behavior without changing tools
class DynamicModelMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def wrap_model_call(self, request, handler):
        if len(request.state["messages"]) > 10:
            # Switch to more capable model for complex conversations
            return handler(request.override(model=advanced_model))
        return handler(request)

# Create agent with middleware - adds behavior like logging & error handling
agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[calculator, search],
    middleware=[DynamicModelMiddleware(), ToolErrorMiddleware()],  # Plugin-style behavior!
)
```

**Code**: [`code/04_agent_with_middleware.py`](./code/04_agent_with_middleware.py)  
**Run**: `python 05-agents/code/04_agent_with_middleware.py`

**Example code:**

**What is middleware?** Middleware intercepts and modifies agent behavior without changing your tools or agent logic. Think of it as "plugins" for your agent.

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import AgentMiddleware, ModelRequest
from langchain.agents.middleware.types import ModelResponse
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from typing import Callable, Any

# Middleware 1: Dynamic Model Selection
# Switches to a more capable (and expensive) model for complex conversations
class DynamicModelMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def __init__(self, messages_threshold: int = 10):
        super().__init__()
        self.messages_threshold = messages_threshold

    def wrap_model_call(
        self,
        request: ModelRequest,
        handler: Callable[[ModelRequest], ModelResponse],
    ) -> ModelResponse:
        message_count = len(request.state["messages"])
        print(f"  [Middleware] Message count: {message_count}")
        
        # Option for complex conversations (>threshold messages)
        if message_count > self.messages_threshold:
            print("  [Middleware] Switching to more capable model")
            # return handler(request.override(model=advanced_model))
        
        return handler(request)


# Middleware 2: Custom Error Handling
# Catches tool failures and provides helpful fallback messages
class ToolErrorMiddleware(AgentMiddleware):
    def wrap_tool_call(
        self,
        request: Any,
        handler: Callable[[Any], ToolMessage],
    ) -> ToolMessage:
        try:
            return handler(request)
        except Exception as e:
            tool_name = request.tool_call.get("name", "unknown")
            print(f"  [Middleware] Tool '{tool_name}' failed: {e}")
            # Return graceful fallback instead of crashing
            return ToolMessage(
                content=f"I encountered an error: {e}. Let me try a different approach.",
                tool_call_id=request.tool_call.get("id", ""),
            )


# Create agent with both middleware
agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools=[calculator, search],
    middleware=[DynamicModelMiddleware(), ToolErrorMiddleware()]
)
```

### Expected Output

When you run `python 05-agents/code/04_agent_with_middleware.py`:

```
 Agent with Middleware Example

Test 1: Simple calculation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 User: What is 25 * 8?

  [Middleware] Message count: 1
  [Middleware] ✓ Using current model

 Agent: 25 multiplied by 8 equals 200.


Test 2: Search with error handling
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 User: Search for information about error handling

  [Middleware] Message count: 1
  [Middleware] ✓ Using current model
  [Middleware] ️  Tool "search" failed: Search service temporarily unavailable
  [Middleware]  Returning fallback message

 Agent: I encountered an error while using the search tool. Let me try
a different approach to answer your question about error handling.

 Middleware Benefits:
   • Dynamic model selection → Cost optimization
   • Error handling → Graceful degradation
   • Logging → Easy debugging
   • Flexibility → Customize behavior without changing tools

 Production Use Cases:
   • Switch to cheaper models for simple queries
   • Automatic retries with exponential backoff
   • Request/response logging for monitoring
   • User context injection (auth, permissions)
   • Rate limiting and quota management
```

### How Middleware Works

**Middleware Flow**:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Middleware: Dynamic Model Selection]
    B -->|Chooses right model| C[Agent Decision: which tool?]
    C --> D[Middleware: Error Handler]
    D -->|Wraps tool execution| E[Tool Execution]
    E -->|May fail here| F[Middleware: Error Handler]
    F -->|Catches errors, returns fallback| G[Agent Response]
```

**Two Middleware Types**:

1. **wrap_model_call** - Intercepts calls TO the model
   - Dynamic model selection based on conversation length
   - Request logging and monitoring
   - Context injection (user permissions, session data)

2. **wrap_tool_call** - Intercepts tool executions
   - Error handling and retries
   - Tool result transformation
   - Permission checks before tool execution

**Production Benefits**:
-  **Cost Optimization**: Use cheap models for simple tasks, expensive for complex
-  **Resilience**: Graceful error handling prevents agent crashes
-  **Observability**: Log all requests for debugging and monitoring
-  **Flexibility**: Add behavior without modifying tools or agent core logic

**When to use middleware**:
- Production agents that need reliability
- Multi-tenant applications (different users, different permissions)
- Cost-sensitive applications
- Systems requiring audit logs

---

##  Tool Selection Logic

The agent uses tool **names** and **descriptions** to match queries to tools:

| User Query | Tool Selected | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| "What is 50 * 25?" | calculator | Matches "mathematical calculations" |
| "Weather in Tokyo?" | get_weather | Matches "weather for a city" |
| "Tell me about X" | search | Matches "search for information" |

**Tips for better tool selection**:
1. Use **descriptive names** - `get_weather` not `tool1`
2. Write **clear descriptions** - explain what the tool does
3. Document **parameters** - use docstrings with Args sections
4. Be **specific** - more detail helps the LLM choose correctly

<img src="images/tool-selection-logic.png" alt="Agent Tool Selection Process" width="800"/>

*Agents intelligently select the right tool based on semantic matching between the query and tool descriptions.*

---

##  Key Takeaways

- **Agents make autonomous decisions** - They choose which tools to use and when
- **ReAct pattern is the core**: Reason → Act → Observe → Repeat until solved
- **create_agent() is production-ready** - Handles the ReAct loop automatically with built-in error handling
- **Tool descriptions matter** - Clear descriptions help agents pick the right tool
- **Middleware adds flexibility** - Plugin-style behavior for logging, error handling, dynamic model selection
- **Start simple, scale up** - Begin with basic agents, add middleware for production needs

---

## ️ Concept Map

This lab taught you how agents use the ReAct pattern for autonomous reasoning:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Query] --> B[Thought]
    B --> C{Need Tool?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Action]
    D --> E[Observation]
    E --> B
    C -->|No| F[Answer]
```

*Agents iterate (Think → Act → Observe) until they solve the problem.*

##  Troubleshooting

Common issues you might encounter when building agents:

### "Agent loops forever or hits max iterations"

**Cause**: Agent doesn't have a stopping condition or tools don't return useful results

**Fixes**:
1. Check your stopping condition:
```python
if not response.tool_calls or len(response.tool_calls) == 0:
    # Agent has finished - no more tools needed
    break
```

2. Lower `max_iterations` to fail fast during development:
```python
max_iterations = 3  # Start small, increase if needed
```

3. Ensure tools return meaningful results - vague outputs confuse the agent

### "Tool not found" error

**Cause**: Tool name mismatch between what LLM generates and what you defined

**Fix**: Verify the tool name exactly matches:
```python
@tool
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:  # Name must match exactly
    """Perform mathematical calculations."""
    # ...
```

### Agent makes wrong tool choices

**Cause**: Tool descriptions aren't clear enough

**Fix**: Improve tool descriptions with specific use cases:
```python
#  Vague
"""Does calculations"""

#  Clear
"""Perform mathematical calculations like addition, multiplication, percentages. 
Use this when you need to compute numbers."""
```

### Agent gets stuck repeating the same tool

**Cause**: Tool doesn't provide enough information for agent to progress

**Fix**: Ensure tool results are descriptive:
```python
#  Not helpful
return "42"

#  Descriptive
return "The calculation result is 42. This is the answer to 6 * 7."
```
