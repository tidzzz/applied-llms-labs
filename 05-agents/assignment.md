## Challenge: Research Agent 

**Goal**: Build an agent using `create_agent()` that answers questions requiring web search and calculations.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `research_agent.py` in the `05-agents/solution/` folder
2. Create two tools:
   - **Search Tool**: Simulates web search (return pre-defined results for common queries)
   - **Calculator Tool**: Performs mathematical calculations
3. Build an agent using `create_agent()` with both tools
4. Test with queries that require multiple steps
5. Display clear output showing which tools the agent used

**Example Queries**:
- "What is the population of Tokyo multiplied by 2?"
  - Step 1: Search for Tokyo population
  - Step 2: Calculate population * 2
  - Step 3: Provide answer
- "Search for the capital of France and tell me how many letters are in its name"
  - Step 1: Search for capital of France
  - Step 2: Calculate letters in "Paris"
  - Step 3: Provide answer

**Success Criteria**:
- Agent uses `create_agent()` (the recommended LangChain approach)
- Both tools are properly defined with clear descriptions
- Agent autonomously decides which tool to use for each query
- Agent correctly handles multi-step queries that require using both tools
- Clear console output shows which tools were used
- Agent provides accurate final answers

**Hints**:
```python
# 1. Import required modules
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# 2. Define your search tool using @tool decorator:
#    Sample search data to get you started:
#    {
#      "population of tokyo": "Tokyo has a population of approximately 14 million...",
#      "capital of france": "The capital of France is Paris.",
#      "capital of japan": "The capital of Japan is Tokyo.",
#      "population of new york": "New York City has a population of approximately 8.3 million.",
#      # Add more...
#    }
#
#    Implementation tips:
#    - Create a dict with search results
#    - Convert the query to lowercase
#    - Loop through entries and check if query includes key or key includes query
#    - Return matching result or "No results found"
#
#    Use Pydantic BaseModel for args_schema with:
#    - query: str = Field(description="The search query...")

# 3. Define your calculator tool using @tool decorator:
#    - Use Python's eval() with restricted builtins for safe expression evaluation
#    - Example: eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, {"abs": abs, ...})
#    - Return result as a string
#    - Handle errors with try/except
#
#    Schema should have:
#    - expression: str = Field(description="The mathematical expression...")

# 4. Create the ChatOpenAI model with your environment variables

# 5. Create agent using create_agent():
#    agent = create_agent(model, tools=[search_tool, calculator_tool])

# 6. Test with multi-step queries in a loop:
#    queries = ["What is the population of Tokyo multiplied by 2?", ...]
#    for query in queries:
#        response = agent.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]})
#        last_message = response["messages"][-1]
#        print(last_message.content)

# 7. Optional: Display which tools were used:
#    tool_calls = []
#    for msg in response["messages"]:
#        if isinstance(msg, AIMessage) and msg.tool_calls:
#            tool_calls.extend([tc["name"] for tc in msg.tool_calls])
#    print(f"Tools used: {', '.join(set(tool_calls))}")
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Query: "What is the population of Tokyo multiplied by 2?"
- Agent automatically:
  1. Uses search tool to find Tokyo's population (≈14 million)
  2. Uses calculator tool to multiply by 2
  3. Returns "The population of Tokyo multiplied by 2 is 28 million."

**Hints**:
- Follow the pattern from Examples 1 and 2 in the lab
- Use create_agent() - it handles the ReAct loop automatically
- Focus on creating well-described tools so the agent knows when to use them
- The agent will iterate through tools until it has enough information to answer

## Bonus Challenge: Multi-Step Planning Agent 

**Goal**: Build an agent with multiple specialized tools using `create_agent()` that requires multi-step reasoning to solve complex queries.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `planning_agent.py`
2. Create four specialized tools:
   - **Search Tool**: Find factual information
   - **Calculator Tool**: Perform calculations
   - **Unit Converter Tool**: Convert between units (miles/km, USD/EUR, etc.)
   - **Comparison Tool**: Compare two values and determine which is larger/smaller
3. Create agent using `create_agent()` with all four tools
4. Add helpful console output showing:
   - Which tools were used
   - Summary at the end showing total tool calls
5. Test with complex multi-step queries

**Complex Query Examples**:
- "What's the distance between London and Paris in miles, and is that more or less than 500 miles?"
  - Step 1: Search for distance (gets: ~343 km)
  - Step 2: Convert km to miles (gets: ~213 miles)
  - Step 3: Compare with 500 miles (gets: less than)
  - Step 4: Answer with complete information

- "Find the population of New York and Tokyo, calculate the difference, and tell me the result in millions"
  - Step 1: Search NY population
  - Step 2: Search Tokyo population
  - Step 3: Calculate difference
  - Step 4: Convert to millions
  - Step 5: Answer

**Success Criteria**:
- All four tools are properly defined with clear descriptions
- Agent uses `create_agent()` to handle multi-tool selection
- Agent autonomously uses multiple tools in sequence
- Handles queries requiring 3+ tool calls
- Clear output shows which tools were used
- Summary displays total tool usage

**Hints**:
```python
# 1. Import required modules
import os
from typing import Literal
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# 2. Define your four specialized tools:

# Search Tool (reuse from Challenge 1)
# Calculator Tool (reuse from Challenge 1)

# Unit Converter Tool - sample conversion data:
#    conversions = {
#      "km": {"miles": {"rate": 0.621371, "unit": "miles"}},
#      "miles": {"km": {"rate": 1.60934, "unit": "kilometers"}},
#      "usd": {"eur": {"rate": 0.92, "unit": "EUR"}},
#      "eur": {"usd": {"rate": 1.09, "unit": "USD"}},
#    }
#
#    Schema needs: value (float), from_unit (str), to_unit (str)

# Comparison Tool - handle operations:
#    "less" -> check if value1 < value2
#    "greater" -> check if value1 > value2
#    "equal" -> check if value1 == value2
#    "difference" -> return abs(value1 - value2)
#
#    Schema needs: value1 (float), value2 (float), operation (Literal enum)

# 3. Create the ChatOpenAI model

# 4. Create agent using create_agent():
#    Pass model and all four tools

# 5. Test with complex queries in a loop and display results

# 6. Display which tools were used:
#    Filter messages for AIMessage with tool_calls
#    Extract tool names and show unique tools + total count
```

**Additional Features** (Optional):
- Add detailed console output showing each tool call
- Display a summary of all tools used after the agent completes
- Track and display total execution time
- Add error handling for tool failures

**Example Output**:
```
 Planning Agent: Multi-Step Query

Query: "What's the distance from London to Paris in miles, and is that more or less than 500 miles?"

 Agent: The distance from London to Paris is approximately 213 miles, which is less than 500 miles.

─────────────────────────────────────────────
 Agent Summary:
   • Tools used: search, unit_converter, comparison_tool
   • Total tool calls: 3
   • Query solved successfully!
```

**Note**: The agent handles the ReAct loop internally, so you won't see individual iterations unless you add custom logging.
